                    <h1>Basic document flow</h1>

                    <p>I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on new lines below me.</p>
                    
                    <p>By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and we are as tall as our child content. Our total width and height is our content + padding + border width/height.</p>
                    
                    <p>We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are separated by the width of one of our margins, not both.</p>
                    
                    <p>inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit on the same line along with adjacent text nodes, if there is space on the same line. Overflowing inline elements will <span>wrap onto a new line if possible (like this one containing text)</span>, or just go on to a new line if not, much like this image will do: <img src="long.jpg"></p>
                    
                    <p>I'm just playing around <span>with</span>a few <span>things</span>in the box mod<span>el</span></p>

                    <p class="marker">This is just more sample text I came up with.  The 1st 4 boxes are copy/pasta from an Odin Project excercise.</p>
